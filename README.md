### Installation
No necessary libraries required to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Data to better understand:

> - Which is the best time for someone to visit Seattle ?
> - What are the kind of rooms most requested ?
> - What are the features that most impact the price ?
> - What are the most affordable areas to stay ?


### File Descriptions
The notebook available here(proj1_airbnbdata) showcases work related to the above questions.


### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
